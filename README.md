# Description
A Euro holiday website which provides visitors the facility to look up locations for different holiday types around Europe. The website is intended to be accessible on all type of devices<br> mobile phone, tablet, laptop and desktop.

# UX

### Strategy
The object of the website is to inform visitor of different locations around Europe that cater for holiday type such as beach holiday, city breaks and skiing holidays. Providing location information and the ability to choose a resort/hotel, holiday date and airline to book. This booking will be saved to site holiday history.

### Business Goals
*  External user goals: <br>
   The site’s user are visitors looking to find information on holidaying    around Europe according to holiday type (beach, city and skiing holidays)
   Then book holiday based on their choice of holiday.

* Site owner's goal: <br>

## User Stories
* As a First Time Visitor: <br>
    “I  would like to find holiday in Europe based on different holiday types”

“I  would like to find where I can book a skiing holiday resort choices around Europe”

“I  would like to book a holiday in Europe based on resort site information recommendations”

* As a Regular Visitor:


## Scope
This website incorporate Minimal Viable Product (MVP) elements.

   * Fullfills the needs of both the external user (visitors to the site) and business owner with features holiday type picker, google api map display based on country/city, map marker for resort/hotel with information and booking form for holiday.

   * Website not cluttered with too much information. Band and gig Information is clearly presented. Site is easy to navigate.

## Structure
The website comprises of one webpages. The page provides the visitor with information based on holiday type chosen populate countries where holiday type existing. From these countrys displayed a country is selected a map of the country is generated with map markers of the available resort/hotel.
A booking button is available to click on  which shows a form with the options(dropdown list) of the resort/hotels for the country to choose from, option(dropdown list) of airlines which fly there, a date picker and a submit button to submit your holiday choice. To enhance UX experience I have included a feature where the active site page button title name is underlined to inform user of what section he is on.

## Skeleton
In the main the wireframes more or less match my final project.
See links to relevent section of the wireframes below:

##  Images
The images were choosen to convey a holiday vibe to entice the visitor 
to check out the site options. The images also blended in well with the 
sites colour scheme.

## Colours
I choose blue backcolour for the site title page. For the navigation bar
I choose grey buttons with white black for site title on the button. When the vistors moves/hovers the mouse pointer over the button it changes/transitons to black once mouse moves away its returns to grey colour this is to provide a better UX experience for the user.

## Typography
I used Google fonts to enhance some text sections of the site. I decided on 
Abril with backup sans-serif for text headings on the home page.
